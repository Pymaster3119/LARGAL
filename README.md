# LARGAL
## By Aditya Anand

LARGAL is an AI-detection and classification for detecting and classifying radio galaxies. It uses YOLO v8s to find radio galaxies, a variational autoencoder to encode radio galaxies in a smaller latent space, and a histogram gradient boosting model is trauned on the latent representations of the VAE.
